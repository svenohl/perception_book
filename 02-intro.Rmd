# Why studying perception?

>*In chapter 1, you will visit again the main reason why studying perception is so exciting. Moreover, understanding how we perceive is pretty challenging, which we will discuss using Moravec's Paradox.*
   
## A very short review   

### What is perception?

This question might seem odd in the beginning. Of course perception is what we see, hear, smell, taste and feel. It might look surprising to you that people are still struggling to define what perception actually is. For instance what are the main characteristics of perception? What is the border between perception and thinking? What are the goals of perception?   

### What is the main challenge?
Short intro: Constructive process/inference (Poverty of the stimulus; interactive 3D example plus accidental view; same applies to motion, color, etc). The solution are simple rules (or algorithms using some environmental information often referred to a cue for a particular problem).

There are infinite solutions of the visual environment based on the retinal image.

### What is easy and what is hard?

- Reflection: Can you think of sth where understanding perception really helps?
- Find other examples of Moravec's paradox
- Reflect on whether we really understand how playing chess works
- Could you think of sth that is really easy to solve for the mind/brain?
