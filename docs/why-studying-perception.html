<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.1</span> What is perception?</h3>
<p>It's a good question how to define perception. In fact, it is such a good question that - contrary to the typical narrative flow of lectures - we take the time to ask and answer that question only at the end of the semester. Here, I want to point out that there are many exciting questions that are important to define perception and that are actively being explored, such as what are the main characteristics of perception? What are the borders between perception and thinking? Can our thoughts influence how we perceive? What are the goals of perception (e.g., providing veridical information/ news about the environment)? The good thing is, we can already learn an incredible amount of interesting things about perception without having finally settled on some of these basic questions. So, instead of giving you a definition, I want to formulate an invitation to think about what constitutes perception during the course.</p>

<div id="what-is-easy-and-what-is-hard" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.2</span> What is easy and what is hard?</h3>
<p>When we think of certain skills of our brain, most of us have a wrong intuition of which tasks are easy for the brain and which are hard. This is easier to understand if we try to build certain abilities like thinking, speaking, seeing or moving in a robot. Before you read any further, think for yourself about what is likely to be hardest to build. Over the years, people were convinced that a chess-playing robot was the big goal. Once that was achieved, all other tasks would be child's play. This assumption turned out to be wrong, which brings us directly to Moravec's paradox. This paradox states that high-level thinking often actually requires very little computation. Low-level sensorimotor skills, however, require enormous computational resources. What we humans perceive as a hard thinking task is easy for a robot, and what we perceive as easy is very hard for robots. Today, you can easily buy a cheap chess computer against which even the best grandmasters lose, but there are no robots that can compete with the visual and motor abilities of young children. Therefore, a complementary research approach of empirical investigation with experiments (analytic approach) and the implementation in computational systems like robots (synthetic approach) is particularly promising. As Richard Feynman famoulsy put it in his quote &quot;What I cannot build. I do not understand&quot;.</p>

<div id="what-is-the-main-challenge" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.3</span> What is the main challenge?</h3>
<p>You've just learned that perceiving is effortless for you, but in fact it is a complex task to generate perception. Many neurons in the brain are involved in constructing perception. But why are there so many neurons for perception? What is the problem that these many neurons try to solve? Well, here it is as expressed for vision:</p>
<pre><code>There are infinite possible interpretations of the image falling   
onto the back of your eye (i.e., the retinal image).</code></pre>
<p>This challenge is so fundamental to the vision sciences, that it got its own name — the poverty of the stimulus problem. It means that the retinal image (i.e., the stimulus) does not provide sufficient information (i.e, the poverty) to allow a single, unambigous interpretation. Sometimes you will read that a problem is under-constrained, or ill-posed, which basically means the same as above. Please note, there is one school of thought — ecological perception — that rejects the idea of a poor visual stimulus. They have some good arguments, but their way of thinking about vision is not really main-stream. For now, we will stick with the idea of ill-posed problems in vision, but keep in mind that vision scientists still argue whether the retinal image is sufficient or insufficient to enable (direct) perception.</p>
<p>Scientists and artists have created tons of examples to demonstrate that multiple (actually infinite) interpretations based on an input are possible. [provide classic example here; maybe make the point that similar examples exist for language --&gt;chomsky]. While these examples may seem artificial, for your visual system the poverty of the stimulus problem concerns any retinal image at any point in time [An ecological psychologist would probably say, these are still very artificial‚]. The problem is particularly obvious when it comes to 3D-vision. We construct a perception of a three-dimensional world based on a two-dimensional retinal image. This three-dimensional world is not present in the retinal image, and must be inferred. We will hear more about this once we address depth perception in a later session.</p>
<p>But surprisingly, it seems that we all perceive pretty much the same things around us. This is truley remarkable. Imagine you assign many people (across all ages from babies to elderly) a simple math task (let's say what is 100 - 37) that requires some computation/inference. It is reasonable to expect that an average person should be able to solve that easy task. It is also reasonable to expect that quite some people will get the wrong results (nobody is perfect and some people are simply not good in math). Moreover, you don't expect young children — that never got in touch with number &gt;10 — or all elderly to give the correct answer. So, once you are done collecting the answers of particpants, you will notice a certain distribution of reported results (distributed with some variance around the true result of 63). Vision, in contrast, has to solve an incredibly harder problem and still all our brains seem to arrive at the same conclusion. Impressive, right? This points to rules (or mechanisms) that are hard-wired in the brain and work very reliably. It is vision scientists' goal to identify such rules of vision. This endevear is highly interdisciplinary and includes methods from psychology, neuroscience, medicine, computer science, robotics, physics, mathematics, and philosophy. We will touch upon methods from all these fields and see how they tell us something about perception.</p>
