It turns out that maps play an outstanding role in  all sensory modalities of  perception. But how should one think of such a brain map underlying perception? To appreciate the importance of maps, it is worth taking a step back and looking at maps in general. Cartography (map-making, plus figure of famous maps). Broadly speaking a map is a representation of something. [Text]. The cartographer is mapping for instance an environment (e.g., streets in a city) onto a surface (e.g., paper). Scientists face a different problem when studying brain maps in perception. 2.1 Sensory 2.2 Retinotopic maps 2.3 Other points Benefits of maps (see Tics review) All kinds of map charaxcteristics (see Seeing book; continuous maps etc.) Topology The packing problem in general Excercise 1: Pay attention how maps are part of our daily life.
