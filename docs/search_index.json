In chapter 1, you will learn about an insight from robotics that perception is complicated (Moravec’s Paradox). Moreover, we will look at the main reason why perception is hard (poverty of the stimulus problem). 1.1 A very short review 1.1.1 What is perception? For any field of research it is important to come up with a good definition. Contrary to the typical narrative flow of lectures, we will try to come up with the defining characteristics of perception only at the end of this course. At this point, I would rather like to spark your interest that there are many exciting — and actively explored — questions that we first need to think about before we find a good definition for perception. Questions such as what are the borders between perception and thinking? Can our thoughts influence how we perceive or is perception independent of that? Do we perceive the world as it is, or is it possible that we live in a big perceptual illusion? What are the goals of perception (e.g., providing veridical information/ news about the environment)? The good thing is, we can already learn an incredible amount of interesting things about perception without having finally settled on some of these basic questions. So, instead of giving you a definition, I want to formulate an invitation to think about what constitutes perception throughout this course. 1.1.2 What is easy and what is hard? Most of us have a wrong intuition about our own brain skills. Tyically, we underestimate how complex a seemingly easy task is. This problem becomes more obvious once we aim to build certain abilities like thinking, speaking, moving or perceiving in an artificial system like a robot. Before you read any further, think for yourself about what is likely to be a hard task for a robot. Over the years, scientists were convinced that understanding how humans play chess is the most challenging task. Once we can build a robot that play chess, all other tasks would be easy to solve. This assumption turned out to be completely wrong, which brings us directly to Moravec’s paradox. This paradox states that high-level thinking often actually requires very little computation (i.e., is easy to solve). Low-level sensorimotor skills, however, require enormous computational resources (i.e., is tough so build). Thus, what humans perceive as a hard problem is easy for a robot, and what we perceive as easy is very hard for robots. Today, you can easily buy a cheap chess computer against which even the best grandmasters lose, but there are no robots that can compete with the visual and motor abilities of young children. Thus, a complementary research approach of empirical investigation with experiments (analytic approach) and the implementation in computational systems like robots (synthetic approach) is particularly promising to reach a better understanding of brain functions. As Richard Feynman famoulsy put it in his quote “What I cannot build. I do not understand”. 1.1.3 What is the main challenge? You’ve just learned that perceiving is effortless for you, but in fact it is a complex task to generate perception. Many neurons in the brain are involved in constructing perception. But why are there so many neurons for perception? What is the problem that these many neurons try to solve? Well, here it is in short as expressed for the domain of vision: There are infinite possible interpretations of the image falling onto the back of your eye (i.e., the retinal image). This challenge is fundamental to the vision sciences. Sometimes it is referred to as the poverty of the stimulus problem. It means that the retinal image (i.e., the stimulus) does not provide sufficient information (i.e, the poverty) to allow a single, unambigous interpretation. (Please note: the poverty of the stimulus is originally a famous problem in linguistics showing that language is ambiguous, too). Sometimes you will read that a problem is under-constrained, or ill-posed, which basically means the same as above. Please note, there is one school of thought — ecological perception — that rejects the idea of a poor visual stimulus. They have some good arguments, but their way of thinking about vision is not really main-stream. For now, we will stick with the idea of ill-posed problems in vision, but keep in mind that vision scientists still argue whether the retinal image is sufficient or insufficient to enable (direct) perception. Scientists and artists have created tons of examples to demonstrate that multiple (actually infinite) interpretations based on an input are possible (see one example in the Figure below). We typically perceive a black, rotated rectangle that occludes a grey square. You don’t see the grey square in this example, but your brain automatically registers that shape as a square. Figure. a Rotated black rectangle seems to occlude a grey square. b Moving the two objects apart reveals the grey square. c Alternatively, moving the black rectangle away, could reveal a more complex grey object. The poverty of the stimulus problem is particularly obvious when it comes to depth perception. We construct a perception of a three-dimensional (3D) world based on a two-dimensional (2D) retinal image. We lose one dimension by the projection onto the flat 2D retina. The third dimension needs to inferred by the visual system. Take a moment and let that important point sink in. Here is another example. In the next Figure you will first see a black square. After some time, it starts moving and it turns out that the square is actually a cube. Obviously, you perceived the black square because I displayed the box from a particular direction (i.e., I created an accidental viewpoint), but it illustrates the point that our visual system can processes only a 2D retinal image. Your brain adds the third dimension using rules that it aquired throughout evolution. Figure. Accidental viewpoint and rotating cube. Probably the most famous example for an ambiguous stimulus is the Necker cube (Figure #). It is a two-dimensional drawing that is immediately perceived as 3D cube Importantly, two different 3D interpretations are possible and you may notice that your perception of the cube will change after a few seconds. While these examples may seem artificial, for your visual system the poverty of the stimulus problem concerns any retinal image at any point in time (An ecological psychologist would probably say, these are still very artificial). Figure. a Necker cube. b and c Front view filled in red solves the bistable perception. But surprisingly, it seems that we all perceive pretty much the same things around us. This is truley remarkable. Imagine you assign a group of people (across all ages from babies to elderly) a simple math task (let’s say what is 100 - 37) that requires some computation/inference. It is reasonable to expect that an average person should be able to solve that easy task. It is also reasonable to expect that quite some people will arrive at a wrong result (nobody is perfect and some people are simply not good in math). Moreover, you don’t expect young children, that never got in touch with numbers &gt;10, or all elderly to give the correct answer. So, once you are done collecting the answers of particpants, you will notice a certain distribution of reported results (distributed with some variance around the true result of 63). Vision, in contrast, has to solve an incredibly harder problem and still all our brains seem to arrive at the same conclusion. Impressive, right? This points to rules (or mechanisms) that are hard-wired in the brain and work very reliably. It is vision scientists’ goal to identify such rules of vision. This endevear is highly interdisciplinary and includes methods from psychology, neuroscience, medicine, computer science, robotics, physics, mathematics, and philosophy. We will touch upon methods from all these fields and see how they tell us something about perception. 1.2 Excercises for next week For next week, I would like to ask you to think about, and answer, the following questions. Each answer should have a length of about 100 words. Vision scientists aim to uncover rules of vision. What could be such a rule that explains why we see a black rectangle on top of a grey square (panel b in the Figure above) rather than someting like displayed in panel c? (100 words) What do you think are the goals of perception? (100 words) Can you think of something where (and why) understanding perception really helps? (100 words) Can you think other another example where Moravec’s paradox applies?

Neurons during early perceptual processing have an interesting property—they are organized in sensory maps. 2.1 A very short review Our current understanding of perception builds on complementary research traditions and one of them is the neurophysiological approach. It is an intuitive approach that resembles a reverse engineering logic, which I will briefly illustrate in an example. Imagine you found an old television system that you parents’ place and you would like to understand how it works. You unscrew the box which will reveal many assembled parts that you don’t really understand. But you also see a cable that is attached to the TV’s start button. You check where the cable goes and you see how it is connected to another part. You might wonder what the function of this new part is. You could test the role of this part by carefully removing it. Once you have a better idea how the initial parts work you could start looking at where the cables lead away from this part. The neurophysiological approach is very similar to that strategy. A good starting point to understand the visual system is to study the first cells in the retina and how they are connected to other cells. Alternatively, you could start at the level of the retina where output is generated and sent to the brain. Over the years you can build up the complexity of the system that you study by increasing the number of steps (e.g., number of neurons) that you moved away from the retina. Obviously, it is a lot of work, but this approach (which I presented heavily oversimplified) has provided many important insights into the functioning of the sensory brain. (But there is also a critical meta view on this approach if we will ever come to an understanding of a system using these methods. See some of the highlighted additional readings). Now, it is necessary to briefly introduce neurons because the activity of single neurons in response to particular stimuli has revealed stunning insights into the functioning of the sensory processing in the brain. For the purposes of this course it will be sufficient to explain neurons in a pretty short and abstract way. 2.1.1 Neurons A neuron is the basic computational unit in the brain. Its function can be summarized as receiving input and generating output. Neurons receive input in the dendrites, and if the input exceeds a threshold they will generate an output (i.e., an action potential). The action potential travels along the axon to pass on a signal to the next neurons. A neuron can receive from and send output to many other neurons. If an action potential is generated, the neuron is firing. Importantly, there are two ways for a neuron to affect the firing of another neuron — excitation and inhibition. If the forwarded signal increases the chances for the other neuron to generate an action potential we call this an excitatory input. Neurons, however, can also decrease the likelihood for the next neuron to fire, which we call an inhibitory input. The link between two particular neurons is either excitatory or inhibitory. Figure. a Schematic drawing of a neuron – courtesy wikipedia. b Typical visualization of a neural response. Each line represents the occurrence of an action potential. Understanting the orchestrated behavior of neurons is crucial to understand any function of the brain. What is particularly interesting for perception is the following. Neurons are organized in maps during early sensory processing. So, next we will take a look at sensory maps and what is interesting about maps in general. 2.1.2 Sensory maps It would not be surprising if the study of perception (and cognition) had its early roots in cartography rather than physics or philosophy. Maps play an outstanding role in all sensory modalities as they did throughout human history. More generally speaking, making a map means there is some external world property and we would like to map it onto some structure. The external property could be the stars in the sky, that is mapped onto some stone. We will look at some maps in this chapter and learn more about properties of maps. When studying perception we typically do not make new maps. Rather we attempt to understand what properites of the world are represented in a sensory map and what consquences follow from a particular mapping. Introduce topographic maps and provide examples for vision and another modality. The key point in vision is that neighboring points on the retina are also neighbors in sensory maps. 2.1.3 Properties of maps A map is the result from mapping someting onto something. Or in other words, mapping is the process of applying a mathematical function. We will therefore take a look at the discipline within mathematics that deals with mapping space—topology. Use now an example of a real map to explain some properties: continuous domain vs. codomain linear vs. nonlinear direction of mapping adding more dimensions to the map (foreshadow packing problem). Ok, we know there are maps. What’s the benefit of maps. All kinds of map charaxcteristics (see Seeing book; continuous maps etc.) Benefits of maps (see Tics review) Topology The packing problem in general 2.2 Excercises for next week Often it is very useful to see a graphical representation of a stimulus presented in the external world (e.g., an object on a computer screen) in addition to the neuron’s activity. In the figure below, is such an example of a graphical visualization. Imagine a bright disk is presented on dark background. We are interested in two things. First, when is the stimulus presented (time on the x-axis) and second, how bright was the stimulus (intensitiy on the y-axis). In panel a, we see a continuous increase of the stimulus intensity in the time range 0 — 2 seconds after trial onset until the stimulus is maximally bright (i.e., the stimulus is white). Once the stimulus reached its maximal intensity it is suddenly removed. In panel b, we see a sudden onset of the stimulus, with maximal intensity, after 1 second and a sudden offset one second later. In panel c, the stimulus has the same temporal parameters as before, but the stimulus intensity is just half of the previous example (i.e., the the intensity reaches just 0.5 of the intensity represented on the y-axis). Figure. Three stimulus configurations. Sudden onset of bright disk 1s and offset 2s after trial onset. Take a minute for yourself and try to visualize with your inner eyes how you imagine the three different stimuli to look like. If you have an idea, then click below to see the solution. Click to see solution! Figure. 2. Please create a graphical visualization (intensity on y-axis, time on x-axis) for the following stimulus. Figure. 3. Please create one graphical visualization for the following two stimuli (intensity on y-axis, time on x-axis). Figure. 4. Imagine you record the firing of a neuron (occurrence of action potential on y-axis, time on x-axis) for the stimulus in excercise 3. Please visualize the actions potentials for a neuron that only fires in response to: a “red”, b “squares”, c “white OR squares”, and d “white AND squares”. 5. Display three pairs (external world, maps) and name correct map properties.

Please take a look at the following famous visualization, and find out how many (and what) dimensions are displayed in the plot. Warming stripes. For more details see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warming_stripes 7. Please take a look at the following thermal image, and find out how many (and what) dimensions are visualized. Thermal image of a cow. 8. In this task, I will show you some external world, and I will ask you to create a map of it with a defined number of dimensions. - 1 dimensional problem on 1 dimension - 2 dimensional problem on 2 dimensions - 2 dimensional problem on 1 dimenions - 3 dimensional problem on 2 dimenions 9. We find maps throughout the brain. In vision, there are a number of maps that preserve some of the spatial relationships of the external world. That means, we find neurons in brain maps that respond only to a particular spatial location in the external world. However, brain maps … [probably bring that point later.] Based on the 2,3,4 dimensional maps anticipate the packing problem. Let the students think about several solutions how one can pack 3 dimensions onto a plane. Find online a map with an interesting story and make a short video that introduces your map (about 2 min). 2.3 Additional reading Can a biologist fix a radio? — Or, what I learned while studying apoptosis.

It turns out that maps play an outstanding role in all sensory modalities of perception. But how should one think of such a brain map underlying perception? To appreciate the importance of maps, it is worth taking a step back and looking at maps in general. Cartography (map-making, plus figure of famous maps). Broadly speaking a map is a representation of something. [Text]. The cartographer is mapping for instance an environment (e.g., streets in a city) onto a surface (e.g., paper).
