In chapter 1, you will visit again the main reason why studying perception is so exciting. Moreover, understanding how we perceive is pretty challenging, which we will discuss using Moravec's Paradox. 1.1 A very short review 1.1.1 What is perception? This question might seem odd in the beginning. Of course perception is what we see, hear, smell, taste and feel. It might look surprising to you that people are still struggling to define what perception actually is. For instance what are the main characteristics of perception? What is the border between perception and thinking? What are the goals of perception? 1.1.2 What is the main challenge? Short intro: Constructive process/inference (Poverty of the stimulus; interactive 3D example plus accidental view; same applies to motion, color, etc). The solution are simple rules (or algorithms using some environmental information often referred to a cue for a particular problem). There are infinite solutions of the visual environment based on the retinal image. 1.1.3 What is easy and what is hard? Moravec's paradox 1.2 Excercises What do you think are the main goals of perception? Reflection: Can you think of sth where understanding perception really helps? Find other examples of Moravec's paradox Reflect on whether we really understand how playing chess works Could you think of sth that is really easy to solve for the mind/brain? 1.3 Further Material Moravec's Paradox and vaccination Ned Block "],["maps.html", "Chapter 2 Maps 2.1 Sensory 2.2 Retinotopic maps 2.3 Other points", " Chapter 2 Maps It would make sense if the study of perception (and cognition) had its early roots in cartography - rather than physics and philosophy. It turns out that maps play an outstanding role in  all sensory modalities of  perception. But how should one think of such a brain map underlying perception? To appreciate the importance of maps, it is worth taking a step back and looking at maps in general. Cartography (map-making, plus figure of famous maps). Broadly speaking a map is a representation of something. [Text]. The cartographer is mapping for instance an environment (e.g., streets in a city) onto a surface (e.g., paper). Scientists face a different problem when studying brain maps in perception. 2.1 Sensory 2.2 Retinotopic maps 2.3 Other points Benefits of maps (see Tics review) All kinds of map charaxcteristics (see Seeing book; continuous maps etc.) Topology The packing problem in general Excercise 1: Pay attention how maps are part of our daily life. Contribute to the discussioin room. Excercise 2: Display maps and get their correct characteristics Excercise 3: find online a map with an intersting story and make a short video that introduces your map.
