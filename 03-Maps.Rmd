# Maps

>*In this session we talked about **neurons**, the brain's most basic processing unit. Neurons during early perceptual processing have an interesting property—they are organized in **sensory maps**.*

## A very short review

It would make sense if the study of perception (and cognition) had its early roots in cartography rather than physics or philosophy. It turns out that maps play an outstanding role in all sensory modalities of perception. But how should one think of such a brain map underlying perception?

- Cartography (map-making, plus figure of famous maps).
Broadly speaking a map is a representation of something. [Text]. The cartographer is mapping for instance an environment (e.g., streets in a city) onto a surface (e.g., paper). Scientists face a different problem when studying brain maps in perception. 

- Make the overall point of how important maps are.

### Neurons
[to do; all you need to know that neurons are firing. We are interested in the fact that sensory neurons change their activity (firing rate) in response to particular stimuli.]
- Show neuron with axon, dendrite and soma. 
- Neurons make connections.
- Firing of neuron will make firing of connected neuron more (excitation) or less likely (inhibtion).
- Abstract neurons and abstract neural networks.
- There are so and so many neurons in the brain which is a pretty abstract number.
- Here I show you an example of a simple neural network that can solve a particular task with x neurons.

Neurons are organized in maps during early sensory processing.

### Sensory maps
[to do; Should conclude with the question what is the benefit of having a map. Lets look at general properties of maps.]
- give an example for vision and another modality

### Properties of maps
- A map is the result from mapping someting onto something. Mapping is the process of applying a mathematical function and we will therefore take a look at the discipline within mathematics that deals with mapping space—topology.

- Use now an example of a real map to explain some properties:
- continuous
- domain vs. codomain
- linear vs. nonlinear
- direction of mapping
- adding more dimensions to the map (foreshadow packing problem).

- Ok, we know there are maps. What's the benefit of maps.

- All kinds of map charaxcteristics (see Seeing book; continuous maps etc.)
- Benefits of maps (see Tics review)
- Topology
- The packing problem in general

## Excercises for next week
- Display maps and name correct map properties.
- Find online a map with an interesting story and make a short video that introduces your map (about 2 min).

## Additional reading
- Maybe theatlantic article.

## Other points 
- Excercise 1: Create and display maps. Please name the number of dimensions, continuous, linearity, direction,
- Excercise 2: find online a map with an intersting story and make a short video that introduces your map.
