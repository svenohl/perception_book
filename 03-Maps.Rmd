# Maps

It would make sense if the study of perception (and cognition) had its early roots in cartography - rather than physics and philosophy. It turns out that maps play an outstanding role in — all sensory modalities of — perception. But how should one think of such a brain map underlying perception? To appreciate the importance of maps, it is worth taking a step back and looking at maps in general.

- Cartography (map-making, plus figure of famous maps).
Broadly speaking a map is a representation of something. [Text]. The cartographer is mapping for instance an environment (e.g., streets in a city) onto a surface (e.g., paper). Scientists face a different problem when studying brain maps in perception.
